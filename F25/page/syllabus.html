                                            The task is for all students to review and grade 4-6 of the videos. 
                                            It is to be completed over the last weekend, after classes finish (but before finals week). 
                                            We will tell you which projects you have been assigned to review; each review should take around 15~20 minutes. 
                                            Here is what we expect you to do for each review:
                                            <li> Watch the video carefully. As you watch the video, jot down some notes/concerns/questions that you might have.</li>
                                            <li>Reference the initial report to clear up any confusion.</li>
                                            <li>You must post at least one comment to the corresponding Piazza post of your reviewee. 
                                                This comment must be a meaningful question or concern that demonstrates you have understood the material.

                                            <li>Finally, fill out the project review form carefully. More details will be shared over Piazza.</li>

                                            11-685 Students may choose to do a Project instead of the guided project. Either your

                                            (on <a href="https://mediaservices.cmu.edu/channel/Introduction%2Bto%2BDeep%2BLearning_Fall%2B2025/385611772" target="_blank">MediaServices</a>).

                                                    If viewed on MediaServices, the lectures of each week must be viewed
                                                    before Monday 8AM of the following week (otherwise, it
                                                    doesn’t count).
                                                </li>

                                            At the end of the semester, we will select a random subset of
                                            lectures and tabulate attendance.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            If you have attended at least 70% of these (randomly chosen) lectures, you
                                            get the attendance point.
                                        </li>

                <h3>Study groups</h3>
                <p>
                    We believe that effective collaboration can greatly enhance student learning.
                    Thus, this course employs study groups for both quizzes and homework ablations.
                    It is highly recommended that you join a study group; Check piazza for further updates.
                </p>

                <h3>Piazza: Discussion Board</h3>
                <p>Piazza is what we use for discussions. You should be automatically signed up if you're enrolled at
                    the start of the semester. If not, please sign up <a href="https://www.piazza.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    Also, please follow the <ahref="etiquette.html">Piazza Etiquette</a> when you use the piazza forum.</p>

                <h3>AutoLab: Software Engineering</h3>
                <p><b>AutoLab</b> is what we use to
                    test your understand of low-level concepts, such as engineering your own libraries, implementing
                    important algorithms, and developing optimization methods from scratch.</p>

                <h3>Kaggle: Data Science</h3>
                <p><a href="https://kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> is where we test your understanding and ability to extend
                    neural network architectures discussed in lecture. Similar to how AutoLab shows scores, Kaggle also shows
                    scores, so don't feel intimidated -- we're here to help. We work on hot AI topics, like speech
                    recognition, face recognition, and neural machine translation.</p>

                <h3>MediaServices/YouTube: Lecture and Recitation Recordings</h3>
                <p> CMU students who are not in the live lectures should watch the uploaded lectures at <b><a
                            href="https://mediaservices.cmu.edu/channel/Introduction%2Bto%2BDeep%2BLearning_Fall%2B2025/385611772"
                            target="_blank">MediaServices</a></b>
                    in order to get attendance credit. Links to individual videos will be
                    posted as they are uploaded.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8hYZGEkI2dDO8scT8C5UQA" target="_blank">Our YouTube
                        Channel</a> is where non-CMU folks can view all lecture and recitation recordings.
                        Videos marked “Old“ are not current, so please be aware of the video title.</p>

                <h3>Books and Other Resources</h3>
                <p>The course will not follow a specific book, but will draw from a number of sources. We list relevant
                    books at the end of this page. We will also put up links to relevant reading material for each
                    class. Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the material before the class. The
                    readings will sometimes be arcane and difficult to understand; if so, do not worry, we will present
                    simpler explanations in class.</p>

                <p>You can also find a nice catalog of models that are current in the literature <a
                        href="http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/concise-visual-summary-of-deep-learning-architectures"
                        target="_blank">here</a>.
                    We expect that you will be in a position to interpret, if not fully understand many of the
                    architectures on the wiki and the catalog by the end of the course.</p>

                <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
                <div>
                    You are expected to comply with the <a
                        href="https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html"
                        target="_blank">University
                        Policy on Academic Integrity and Plagiarism</a>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are allowed to talk with and work with other students on homework assignments.</li>
                        <li>You can share ideas but not code. You should submit your own code.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Your course instructor reserves the right to determine an appropriate penalty based on the violation
                    of academic dishonesty that occurs. Violations of the university policy can result in severe penalties
                    including failing this course and possible expulsion from Carnegie Mellon University. If you have
                    any questions about this policy and any work you are doing in the course, please feel free to contact
                    your instructor for help.
